# VerseCompiler
A verse parser, interpreter and (eventually?) LLVM compiler, written in Java.

# Why Java?
Java is just what I'm best at writing. It's not really ideal, but since this will likely never be used in production (only intended for running tests on your local machine), it's probably fine (if a little slow and cumbersome).
